# Metaverse

Simple Project to demonstrate Metaverse.

- The test metaverse created using three.js library, it have a area where we can mint NFTS.
- Web3 is used to intract with contract.
- Dimentions of a object sent to the contract and the contract mint it as a NFT.
- Once contract mined NFT now we can add it in our metaverse.
